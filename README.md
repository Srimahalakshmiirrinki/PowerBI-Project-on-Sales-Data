# PowerBI-Project-on-Sales-Data

Aim: To Analize Sale Data of Aweasome Chocolates and getting trends out of it.


Tools: I Used PowerBI To Load and Transform data(Cleaning,Removing duplicates and filling values). I Used DAX in powerBI to do some calculations on the Data to get better patterns out of the Data.

1) Actual perfomence by Team and Products. (Sales and profit)

Conclusion: I Created DashBoard based on the requirement. I used Forecast to get the future Sales analasis based on the current Data. while creating forecast i observed there is a inconsistency in the sales in some months. I excluded those months to get the better forecast for next 6 months.
It was a very good experience in working on PowerBi and exploring it's futures.
